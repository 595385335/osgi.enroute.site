## Unable to resolve org.example.foo.api version=1.0.0.201603042130: missing requirement false

The resolve error indicates that the only exporter is the API project but that this project says it should not resolve because in enRoute we highly recommend to include the API package in the provider so a resolution does not just consist of APIs without implementations. If you look in your bnd.bnd file in the org.example.foo.api project then you'll see the following lines:

Require-Capability: \
compile-only

This is a requirement that cannot be resolved. Adding the package to the provider will then make the provider the preferred exporter.

This model (exporting the API from the provider) is explained extensively in the [Base Tutorial][1]. For a more information you can also look in the [bnd manual about versioning][2].

You should there have some org.example.foo.provider bundle that provides the implementation and this should export the API. Exporting it is simple, just drag the package and drop it on the Contents Export list of the provider's `bnd.bnd` file. See the Base tutorial for details.

That said, in the OSGi we now have implementation capabilities and the next OSGi enRoute setup will use those. It is slightly cleaner but also a bit less practical. For now, just export the API from the provider it is the last amount of trouble.


## Can't Resolve!

If you run in the problem that you can't resolve and have a problem understanding, here are some tips.

First, try to resolve ONLY the provider (i.e. is the only requirement in the bndrun file) and see what it says. Likely the provider has a problem. You could also add the bundle that is reported as the last item in the diagnostic information from the resolver in the blacklist in your bndrun file. For example:

	-runblacklist.eval:	\
		osgi.identity;filter:=â€˜(osgi.identity=com.example.foo.provider)

The resolver will then probably provide the next thing it cannot resolve. Which unfortunately is often quite logical and simple :-(

The resolver is pretty bad in telling what the culprit is. The reason is that it uses back-tracking. So the diagnostics are basically the last thing that was tried.
