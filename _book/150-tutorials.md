This section is an entry to the hopefully growing collection of tutorials that OSGi enRoute provides. If you want to develop an additional tutorial, please submit a PR.

## Quick Start

{: .thumb200-l }

In this quick start we develop a little project that, creates a single page web-application. This tutorial is light on the explanations because it focuses on introducing the overall architecture of enRoute, not the details.  We will cover the whole chain, from creating a workspace all the way to continuous integration.

A disclaimer. This quick start is about learning to use OSGi enRoute, not about learning Java, Git, nor Eclipse. It is assumed that you have basic experience with these tools.

## Base Tutorial

{: .thumb200-l }

The Base Tutorial is a very extensive tutorial that takes you to all the principles. It starts from scratch and it brings you all the way to a release cycle with continuous integration. It is absolutely worth the effort to go through this tutorial to really learn OSGi.

## IoT Tutorial

The Internet of Things ... a concept that has as many definitions as there are things you can connect to the Internet. However, most definitions place an emphasis on the _edge devices_ and the _gateways_, which is of course right in the realm that was the raison d'Ãªtre of OSGi already so long ago.

This tutorial uses OSGi enRoute to develop an application for a [Raspberry Pi][pi]. The Raspberry Pi is a formidable machine that would put many laptops to shame a few years ago. The OS is Linux and it has lots of inputs and outputs. For OSGi enRoute, we've developed a number of bundles that allow you to play with the Raspberry. This tutorial will explain how to get started with the Raspberry Pi and then show how to do interesting things.

## Distributed OSGi with Zookeeper

{: .thumb200-l }

This tutorial takes you through the steps to build a trivial Chat application using distributed OSGi. We first build a service API for a Chat client and use this API in an implementation. Then we add a command to test the implementation. After this works, we run a Zookeeper server from Bndtools. This Zookeeper server is used by the Amdatu Distributed OSGi implementation to distribute the Chat services. To finish it off, we create a client in the browser.

## Bundle Wrapping [BETA]

{: .thumb200-l }

The work you probably would like to avoid. However, sometimes you have to go into the messy world of non-OSGi bundles and get your hands dirty. This tutorial takes you in minute detail through the steps that are available to you when you wrap a bundle in an OSGi enRoute workspace. It handles what to include, and what not to include. How to handle dependencies, resources, all the way to the readme and manifest headers.
