[Java is the software industry's leading language](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), a position broadly held since 2003. Yet despite this the average Java developer is not an OSGi developer. 

Why is this?

![Lowering the barriers](/img/book/why-enroute.png)

* Until recently, OSGi examples and tools exposed too much infrastructure to new developers: yes, *OSGi was hard*.
* As demonstrated by DropWizard and Spring Boot the software industry tends to focus on the rapid creation of new simple stand-alone Applications that **"just run"**. In stark contrast, the OSGi Alliance places priority upon the creation and ongoing cost effective maintenance of sophisticated software systems.
* The internet - which never forgets - is littered with outdated (and sometimes woefully incorrect) OSGi tutorials and articles: some of these reflecting the evolution of OSGi principles and best-practices since 1998!

enRoute removes these barriers and provides the onramp via which Java developers can build modern, modular, maintainable software systems.
