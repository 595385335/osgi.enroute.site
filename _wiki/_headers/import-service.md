title: Import-Service
summary: Deprecated header to indicate the dependency on a service
---
 
The `Import-Service` was originally a manifest header that would declare
which services a bundle imported statically. It has been deprecated
(along with its inverse, [Export-Service](Export-Service "wikilink")) as
services are now consumed dynamically rather than requiring static
registration.
