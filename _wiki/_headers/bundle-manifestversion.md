title: Bundle-ManifestVersion
summary: Specifies version of the syntax and semantics of the OSGi headers

The `Bundle-ManifestVersion` is not mandatory, but if missing defaults
to version 1. OSGi R4 introduced `Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2`, and so in
practice, almost all bundles have this entry.

`Bundle-ManifestVersion:Â 2`
