title: Apache Celix
summary: A C based variation on OSGi
---

[Apache Celix](http://incubator.apache.org/celix) is an implementation
of the OSGi Service Platform adapted to C, released under an [Apache
License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

Since the OSGi specification is written for Java, there are some key
differences:

-   Services are exposed via a struct instead of an interface.
-   Instead of exporting/importing packages, services are
    imported/exported.

Apache Celix is an effort undergoing incubation at [The Apache Software
Foundation](http://www.apache.org/) (ASF), sponsored by the [Apache
Incubator](http://incubator.apache.org/) PMC. Incubation is required of
all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have
stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the
completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project
has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
