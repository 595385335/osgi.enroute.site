The OSGi enRoute project is an OSGi Alliance initiative to make it much easier to get started with OSGi. Though OSGi provides tremendous benefits, achieving these benefits requires significantly more work than just adding a nice library or using a framework. Like loosing weight, modularity is a life style, not a process of limited duration. Strong modularity like OSGi provides is a significant step, that is even made more complex because in the Java world we have many popular tools and patterns that are actually anti-modular. This may come as a surprise for some because most developers pride themselves in making modular code. However, in practice, the lack of proper modular tooling and tool chains allows most violations to go unflagged and actually frequently makes it really hard to work modular due to lack of support of functions like semantic versioning.   

In the enRoute project we are creating a tool chain that supports real modualr software engineering while making it much easier to get started. Though some development is unfortunately necessary (at least initially), the majority of what we do in this project is selecting parties that want to collaborate in this chain and making sure that users have one place where they can start working with the tool chain. This means working with partners so that the parts of the chain work together, providing documentation that describes the voids between the different tools, making tutorials that show how the chain works, initiating OSGi specifications for missing aspects, and sometimes creating open source code for crucial pieces that nobody yet has made. And last, but absolutely not least, we want to collect and describe best practices.

Overall, we want to be pragmatic and create a one-stop-solution so that the benefits of OSGi can be obtained without a painful long arduous process of trying to fit a round big peg in a small square hole. 

We are striving to make this project superfluous one day. Once modularity becomes main stream it will no longer be necessary to invest in this effort because the market will take care of it. 

## Operations
The enRoute project heavily relies on open source projects and is actively seeking contributors. We have organized the work around a number of Github repositories in the [OSGi organization](https://github.com/osgi). For example, this site is maintained in the [osgi.enroute.site](https://github.com/osgi/osgi.enroute.site) repository and the [bundles](https://github.com/osgi/bundles) repository contains the bundles that were developed in enRoute (and that we hope will be adopted by an open source organization one day).
