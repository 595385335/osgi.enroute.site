## OSGi Specifications

enRoute is based upon the latest OSGi Alliance Specifications, see:

* [R7 Core Specifications](https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/7.0.0/ch01.html)
* [R7 Compendium Specifications](https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/introduction.html)

Each OSGi Alliance Specification is accompanied by a Reference Implementation and an associated Conformance Test suite. These resources maintained by the OSGi Alliance Members: [OSGi Specification Implementations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi_Specification_Implementations) lists implementations of released Specifications.


## OSGi Toolchains

The following resources provide further information and guidance on developing with OSGi. 

* [The bndtools IDE plugin for Eclipse](http://bndtools.org) - The easy, powerful and productive way to develop with OSGi. Based on bnd and Eclipse.
* [ Maven plugins provided by the Bnd project](https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/tree/master/maven) - The Maven plugins used by enRoute.  
* [The bnd Community Site](http://bnd.bndtools.org) - The engine behind popular software development tools that support OSGi.


## OSGi Developer Certification

The [OSGi Alliance Developer Certification Program](https://www.osgi.org/osgi-compliance/developer-certification/) validates the OSGi skills and knowledge of IT professionals; so providing an independent referenceable verification.

The current certification program is intended for experienced hands-on OSGi Developers. However, the OSGi Alliance are considering an online enRoute Certification, this as a first step towards full Certification.


## OSGi Testimonials

It is increasingly realized that OSGi Specifications provide the modular foundations upon which economically sustainable software solutions can be built. The following [OSGi testimonials](https://www.osgi.org/about-us/testimonials/) demonstrate some of the variety of industries and real world uses that depend upon OSGi. 

If you are already using OSGi then please share your testimonial with us ([Submission guidelines](https://www.osgi.org/about-us/testimonials/testimonial-guidelines/)).
